Continuous data are not restricted to defined separate values, but can occupy any value over a continuous range. Between any two continuous 
data values there may be an infinite number of others. Continuous data are always essentially numeric.
Common user experience metrics using continuous data are usually task times, usability ratings, satisfaction scores, etc.

Binary data can only take particular values. There may potentially be an infinite number of those values, but each is distinct and there's no grey 
area in between. Binary data is categorical -- 
like red or blue, or male or female, or good or bad, or true or false.
Common user experience metrics for binary include task completions, errors, conversions, etc.
